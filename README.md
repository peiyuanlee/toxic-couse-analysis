# Toxic Course Combination Analysis

## Introduction 
Academic success in undergraduate education can be influenced by many external factors, including course selection and student background. While a field like statistics may seem relatively structured, understanding the nuances between required curriculum and course combinations can help students make better informed decisions, optimizing learning to the individual. 

Students also have various academic backgrounds and experiences, and this can also affect how they interact with the academic environment. Transfer students who attended a community college or other university will approach upper-division courses and education with a different perspective compared to those that will have attended the same university for all four years. In other words, the barriers of academic success are exceedingly different for students who attended the university starting as a first year, and those who transferred1. 

Some of the factors that influence transfer students’ performance can be their previous accomplishments. In a study focusing on the strongest predictors of academic success (measured via GPA) for transfer students entering into a four-year university, it was found that the most significant predictor was the students’ GPA earned at the community college, with a higher community college GPA correlating to a higher university GPA4. Transfer students accepted into UCLA for the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 academic years tended to have near-perfect GPAs, with the median being 3.90 and 3.88 out of 4.00, respectively (and with upper quartiles of 4.00 both years). This also indicates that it can be expected that transfer students would demonstrate a similar high academic success level within this report7,8. Similarly, high school GPA was found to be the strongest predictor of a four year student’s success in university; applying this to our specific population, four year UCLA students accepted into UCLA for the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 academic years had impressive high school GPAs2,5,6. The interquartile unweighted GPAs ranges for both years were 3.95-4.00 with the medians being 4.00, indicating that it could be expected that four year students, correspondingly, succeed academically5,6. With both groups having similar strong performances upon entry into UCLA and predicted results, there is intrigue into whether the likeness between the two populations continues while at UCLA or a divergence occurs.

Overall, this study aims to analyze these factors and provide insights into potential distinctions between student experiences. These findings may contribute to a deeper understanding of academic performance in Statistics & Data Science at UCLA, with practical applications in designing statistics curriculum and improving academic success. 

## Research Questions
To better understand academic performance among Statistics majors at UCLA, this study explores the following questions:
(1) Which combination of Statistics and Math courses results in the highest overall GPA among Statistics majors at UCLA? 
(2) Is there a difference between transfer students and four-year UCLA students in GPA for upper division statistics courses? 

## Results
The findings of this study reveal significant distinctions in academic performance between freshman and transfer student in the Statistics and Data Science major at UCLA. The analysis of GPA distributions indicates that freshman students generally achieve higher GPAs in upper-division courses compared to transfer students.The Mann-Whitney U test results confirm a statistically significant difference in performance, suggesting that transfer students may face additional challenges when transitioning into upper-division courses. 

In conclusion, educational research is essential for improving student learning outcomes. To enhance how students learn, we must first understand their learning styles. Our research focuses on supporting Statistics and Data Science students by identifying key factors that influence their academic success. While the major has core requirements, students have flexibility in choosing the order of their courses and electives. Investigating the best combinations of statistics and math courses can help advisors guide students to have more effective academic pathways, ultimately improving the program’s overall efficiency.
